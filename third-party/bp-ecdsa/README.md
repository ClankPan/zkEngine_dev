_ECDSA using secp256k1_

## Overview
This repository contains R1CS cicuit for ECDSA signature verification using secp256k1. The files are as follows:
* [`curve.rs`](./src/curve.rs): Implementation of circuits for secp256k1 curve operations
* [`ecdsa.rs`](./src/ecdsa.rs): Implementation of signature verification circuit
* [`utils.rs`](./src/utils.rs): Contains utility functions used to implement curve operations

## Build

Clone the repository and run the following commands:
```bash
cd bp-ecdsa/
cargo build --release
```

## Tests

To run the tests:
```bash
cargo test --release
```

To run a specific test, specify it's name as follows:
```bash
cargo test [name_of_test] --release -- --nocapture
```
